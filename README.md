# About

Common dashboard used by IOTA node software Hornet and Bee.

## Prerequisites

To deploy your own version of the Node Dashboard, you need to have at least [version 14 of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your device.

To check if you have Node.js installed, run the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If Node.js is installed, you should see the version that's installed.

# Getting Started

You need to run a local version of the Hornet node software from the main branch [https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet/](https://github.com/iotaledger/hornet/)

1. Make sure to set `dashboard.dev` to true in Hornet config, to enable the node to serve assets
   from the dev instance.
2. Install all needed npm modules via `npm install`.
3. Run a dev-server instance by running `npm run start` within the repo root directory.
4. Using default port config, you should now be able to access the dashboard under http://127.0.0.1:8081

The dashboard is hot-reload enabled.
